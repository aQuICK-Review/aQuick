This is a simple landing page for what will eventually lead to aQuICK: Accessing Quantum Information and Computing Knowledgement, an Indian initiative for collating and distilling relevant information.

## Technology

Basically a simple [react](https://reactjs.org/) site. Built using [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) though.

Deployed with the excellent [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
